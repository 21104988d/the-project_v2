# The Project - Stablecoin Core Cross-Chain Router

**Version:** v2.2.5  
**Last Updated:** July 23, 2025

## 🌟 Project Overview

A production-ready cross-chain stablecoin routing platform supporting USDT and USDC. The dApp enables secure, efficient transfers of stablecoins across EVM, Solana, Tron, Sui, and NEAR networks using smart contract aggregation and off-chain routing optimization. The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and supports multiple wallet integrations.

### ✅ Development Status

**Infrastructure Foundation (Parts 1-5)** ✅
- Multi-chain setup: EVM, Solana, Tron, Sui, NEAR
- Fee manager smart contracts for all supported chains
- React DApp with multi-wallet integration (MetaMask, Phantom, TronLink, Sui, NEAR)
- Routing engine with price aggregation
- Frontend-only static hosting (Vite)
- Quality assurance: ESLint, Prettier, Jest, manual and automated checklists
- Security: OpenZeppelin patterns, environment validation, key management, role-based access controls

**Repository Verification Complete** ✅
- All packages compile and pass tests
- Docker containers build and run
- Documentation builds without errors

**Next Phase: Production Deployment**
- Mainnet deployment preparation
- Security audits and penetration testing
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Feature expansion: multi-stablecoin support
